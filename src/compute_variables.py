    If absolute=True, the function takes the absolute value of the dispersion difference before computing the tilt, and the range is reduced to [-45,45] deg.
    In this case, the tilt is the angle that the semi-major axis of the velocity ellipse makes with the coordinate axis that it is closest to.
    
    The sign of the tilt is the same independent of `absolute`, and always equal to the sign of the correlation. If positive, the semi-major axis falls
    within the 1st (& 3rd) quadrant of the vx-vy plane. If negative, it falls on the 4th (& 2nd) quadrant.

    The "spherical tilt" is a special case that measures the angle the semi-major axis of the velocity ellipse makes with what I call 
    "R_hat". I call R_hat the direction in position space that joins the GC with the "centre" of the selected group of stars (e.g. the 
    centre of the bin if constructing a kinematic map) out of which you have constructed the velocity ellipse. The spherical tilt 
    quantifies how much the direction of highest dispersion deviates from the direction towards the GC (in the projected 2D view, not 
    taking into account any 3D depth info). I call it "R_hat" because in the xy view the direction is equal to the Galactocentric cylindrical R hat.
    This is not true in other spatial representations (e.g. lb, where R_hat = (l,b) = l*e_l + b*e_b, where e_l and e_b are unit
    vectors in the l and b directions. In this case R_hat would not even be a straight line in real space due to the curved nature of the
    spherical Galactic coordinates).

    Note the spherical tilt is the same as the vertex deviation if we are working with vR-vphi velocities in xy space. However, in contrast
    with the calculate_tilt function, if absolute=True this function returns the absolute value of the spherical tilt, and the range changes 
    from (-90,90] to [0,90] deg.
    
    I follow the convention in Hagen et al. (2019) and define the angle as positive when the semi-major axis of the ellipse is tilted anti-
    clockwise with respect to R_hat, and negative otherwise.
